# Just a basic audio slider for the video Platform BigBlueButton
This was build out of necessity, because the Big blue button video conference platform has no basic volume control built in and doesn't seem to be adding it any time soon with the reason: "We do not want more audio controls, you can just change it in the system settings". Well what if another chrome tab is playing audio? Or maybe I don't want to have to change my system's audio settings every fricking time I have to use the platform.

ps. someone please add an audio slider in the actions bar. If not then I shall do it myself. in the meantime. This will have to suffice.
